        <p>
          As mentioned before, road bikes are very similar to each other. They
          all have similar styles to make the rider as aerodynamic as possible
          as well as have low gear ratios to allow the bike to go super fast.
          The main things that change within this world is tires and the
          material used to create the bike. Although these 2 items may seem
          insignificant, they can change the characteristics of the bike to make
          it feel as though it were a different bike! This activity can be done
          alone although it is usually done as a group.
