          As mentioned before, mountain bikes are mainly used for biking in the
          wilderness. They can double down and be used on the road but this is
          not reccommended as the tires are soft and can do unexpected things on
          the road that may lead to an accident. They also wear much faster on
          the pavement than on the trails. Mountain biking can also be a few
          hours long or can become a journey known as "bike packing." Both
          activies are a lot of fun for people of all ages.

        <h3>Road Bikes</h3>

        <p>
          As mentioned before, road bikes are very similar to each other. They
          all have similar styles to make the rider as aerodynamic as possible
          as well as have low gear ratios to allow the bike to go super fast.
          The main things that change within this world is tires and the
          material used to create the bike. Although these 2 items may seem
          insignificant, they can change the characteristics of the bike to make
          it feel as though it were a different bike! This activity can be done
          alone although it is usually done as a group.
